## How to Play
Use your mouse to control Santa's Sleigh left or right.
Each player has 30 seconds to catch the following objects:

|Items   |Value    |
|--------|---------|
|Presents|Score + 1|
|Coal    |Score - 3|
|Clocks  |Time + 5 |
|Bombs   |Time = 0 |

## Development Process
Technologies Used: HTML5, CSS, Javascript/jQuery

Divs are prepended to the page's body at random locations and are animated to fall down.
Another div is set to the bottom of the page to be used as the catcher.
The catcher is attached to an event listener of "mousemove" to follow where the mouse cursor is.
A function detects if the catcher and the falling div come into contact.
Points and seconds are added or deducted to each player's score board accordingly.
